## Introduction 👋🏻
This repository will be my journey for this years tech-track course. 

The goal of this course is to create a data visualisation (using D3 and if you feel brave you can use more libraries/fameworkes), based on your chosen data where you focus on Architecture, Visualization and/or Storytelling.
